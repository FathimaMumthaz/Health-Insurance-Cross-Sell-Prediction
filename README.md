# Health-Insurance-Cross-Sell-Prediction

#Problem Statement:

Our client, an insurance company, needs help in building a model to predict the likelihood of past health insurance policyholders showing interest in purchasing vehicle insurance from the company. The company charges premiums from customers to provide them with compensation in case of specified loss, damage, illness, or death. By predicting the interest in vehicle insurance, the company can plan its communication strategy and optimize its revenue. The model will be built using information about demographics, vehicles, and insurance policies.
